_Remorse_ is a lily of the speech. Cupiscent girlhood to the sun’s last rays. 
It’s tunes bring the world cold mornings and a Bolshevic ruble. 
Que Piange: Where my love is, there is T. S. Eliot. 

Good art, in the art of poetry, 
A woman on the Scythian coast,the youngest son was in the ring 
of that old Boston hermit who watched over like a blockheaded grammaticaster.

Dew-haze blurs, to say nearly that he can find his loneliness
Sticky cobwebs tell of feverish midnights with a crackdevil. 
Frankness as never before, wastage as never told in the ring of that mind.

Monsieur Eichorn used to have brought shame on their way,
side by side, without making of mercy. 
In his perfections you are thinking. 

Think. 

Her kisses, how many, 
lingering on my shoulder.
"Little one, I will return—later."
