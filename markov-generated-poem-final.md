_Remorse_ is a lily of the speech. Cupiscent girlhood to the sun’s last rays._ 
It’s tunes bring the world cold mornings and a Bolshevic ruble._
Que Piange: Where my love is, there is T. S. Eliot._

Good art, in the art of poetry,_
A woman on the Scythian coast,the youngest son was in the ring_
of that old Boston hermit who watched over like a blockheaded grammaticaster._

Dew-haze blurs, to say nearly that he can find his loneliness_
Sticky cobwebs tell of feverish midnights with a crackdevil._ 
Frankness as never before, wastage as never told in the ring of that mind._

Monsieur Eichorn used to have brought shame on their way,_
side by side, without making of mercy._ 
In his perfections you are thinking._

Think.

Her kisses, how many,_
lingering on my shoulder._
"Little one, I will return—later."_
